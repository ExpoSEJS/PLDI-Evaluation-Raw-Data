For codes where len is less than drop + curr,\n   those top drop + curr - len bits are incremented through all values to\n   fill the table with replicated entries.\n\n   root is the number of index bits for the root table.  When len exceeds\n   root, sub-tables are created pointed to by the root entry with an index\n   of the low root bits of huff.  This is saved in low to check for when a\n   new sub-table should be started.  drop is zero when the root table is\n   being filled, and drop is root when sub-tables are being filled.\n\n   When a new sub-table is needed, it is necessary to look ahead in the\n   code lengths to determine what size sub-table is needed.  The length\n   counts are used for this, and so count[] is decremented as codes are\n   entered in the tables.\n\n   used keeps track of how many table entries have been allocated from the\n   provided *table space.  It is checked for LENS and DIST tables against\n   the constants ENOUGH_LENS and ENOUGH_DISTS to guard against changes in\n   the initial root table size constants.  See the comments in inftrees.h\n   for more information.\n\n   sym increments through all symbols, and the loop terminates when\n   all codes of length max, i.e. all codes, have been processed.  This\n   routine permits incomplete codes, so another loop after this one fills\n   in the rest of the decoding tables with invalid code markers.\n   */\n\n  /* set up for code type */\n  // poor man optimization - use if-else instead of switch,\n  // to avoid deopts in old v8\n  if (type === CODES) {\n    base = extra = work;    /* dummy value--not used */\n    end = 19;\n\n  } else if (type === LENS) {\n    base = lbase;\n    base_index -= 257;\n    extra = lext;\n    extra_index -= 257;\n    end = 256;\n\n  } else {                    /* DISTS */\n    base = dbase;\n    extra = dext;\n    end = -1;\n  }\n\n  /* initialize opts for loop */\n  huff = 0;                   /* starting code */\n  sym = 0;                    /* starting code symbol */\n  len = min;                  /* starting code length */\n  next = table_index;              /* current table to fill in */\n  curr = root;                /* current table index bits */\n  drop = 0;                   /* current bits to drop from code for index */\n  low = -1;                   /* trigger new sub-table when len > root */\n  used = 1 << root;          /* use root table entries */\n  mask = used - 1;            /* mask for comparing low */\n\n  /* check available table space */\n  if ((type === LENS && used > ENOUGH_LENS) ||\n    (type === DISTS && used > ENOUGH_DISTS)) {\n    return 1;\n  }\n\n  /* process all codes and make table entries */\n  for (;;) {\n    /* create table entry */\n    here_bits = len - drop;\n    if (work[sym] < end) {\n      here_op = 0;\n      here_val = work[sym];\n    }\n    else if (work[sym] > end) {\n      here_op = extra[extra_index + work[sym]];\n      here_val = base[base_index + work[sym]];\n    }\n    else {\n      here_op = 32 + 64;         /* end of block */\n      here_val = 0;\n    }\n\n    /* replicate for those indices with low len bits equal to huff */\n    incr = 1 << (len - drop);\n    fill = 1 << curr;\n    min = fill;                 /* save offset to next table */\n    do {\n      fill -= incr;\n      table[next + (huff >> drop) + fill] = (here_bits << 24) | (here_op << 16) | here_val |0;\n    } while (fill !== 0);\n\n    /* backwards increment the len-bit code huff */\n    incr = 1 << (len - 1);\n    while (huff & incr) {\n      incr >>= 1;\n    }\n    if (incr !== 0) {\n      huff &= incr - 1;\n      huff += incr;\n    } else {\n      huff = 0;\n    }\n\n    /* go to next symbol, update count, len */\n    sym++;\n    if (--count[len] === 0) {\n      if (len === max) { break; }\n      len = lens[lens_index + work[sym]];\n    }\n\n    /* create new sub-table if needed */\n    if (len > root && (huff & mask) !== low) {\n      /* if first time, transition to sub-tables */\n      if (drop === 0) {\n        drop = root;\n      }\n\n      /* increment past last table */\n      next += min;            /* here min is 1 << curr */\n\n      /* determine length of next table */\n      curr = len - drop;\n      left = 1 << curr;\n      while (curr + drop < max) {\n        left -= count[curr + drop];\n        if (left <= 0) { break; }\n        curr++;\n        left <<= 1;\n      }\n\n      /* check for enough space */\n      used += 1 << curr;\n      if ((type === LENS && used > ENOUGH_LENS) ||\n        (type === DISTS && used > ENOUGH_DISTS)) {\n        return 1;\n      }\n\n      /* point entry in root table to sub-table */\n      low = huff & mask;\n      /*table.op[low] = curr;\n      table.bits[low] = root;\n      table.val[low] = next - opts.table_index;*/\n      table[low] = (root << 24) | (curr << 16) | (next - table_index) |0;\n    }\n  }\n\n  /* fill in remaining table entry if code is incomplete (guaranteed to have\n   at most one remaining entry, since if the code is incomplete, the\n   maximum code length that was allowed to get this far is one bit) */\n  if (huff !== 0) {\n    //table.op[next + huff] = 64;            /* invalid code marker */\n    //table.bits[next + huff] = len - drop;\n    //table.val[next + huff] = 0;\n    table[next + huff] = ((len - drop) << 24) | (64 << 16) |0;\n  }\n\n  /* set return parameters */\n  //opts.table_index += used;\n  opts.bits = root;\n  return 0;\n};\n"}
