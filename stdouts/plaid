   *                   - headers: required header names (def: date or x-date)
   *                   - algorithms: algorithms to support (default: all).
   *                   - strict: should enforce latest spec parsing
   *                             (default: false).
   * @return {Object} parsed out object (see above).
   * @throws {TypeError} on invalid input.
   * @throws {InvalidHeaderError} on an invalid Authorization header error.
   * @throws {InvalidParamsError} if the params in the scheme are invalid.
   * @throws {MissingHeaderError} if the params indicate a header not present,
   *                              either in the request headers from the params,
   *                              or not in the params from a required header
   *                              in options.
