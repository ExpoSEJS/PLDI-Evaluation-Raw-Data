      Enzyme Internal Error: Enzyme expects an adapter to be configured, but found none. To
      configure an adapter, you should call `Enzyme.configure({ adapter: new Adapter() })`
      before using any of Enzyme's top level APIs, where `Adapter` is the adapter
      corresponding to the library currently being tested. For example:

      import Adapter from 'enzyme-adapter-react-15';

      To find out more about this, see http://airbnb.io/enzyme/docs/installation/index.html
