   The solution is to chunkify the input into smaller strings.\n//      The chunks are stored in the `chunks` var,\n//      `j` holds the current chunk index, and `currentPos` holds\n//      the index of the current chunk in relation to `input`.\n//      This gives us an almost 4x speed-up.\n//\n//    - In many cases, we don't need to match individual tokens;\n//      for example, if a value doesn't hold any variables, operations\n//      or dynamic references, the parser can effectively 'skip' it,\n//      treating it as a literal.\n//      An example would be '1px solid #000' - which evaluates to itself,\n//      we don't need to know what the individual components are.\n//      The drawback, of course is that you don't get the benefits of\n//      syntax-checking on the CSS. This gives us a 50% speed-up in the parser,\n//      and a smaller speed-up in the code-gen.\n//\n//\n//    Token matching is done with the `$` function, which either takes\n//    a terminal string or regexp, or a non-terminal function to call.\n//    It also takes care of moving all the indices forwards.\n//`\n//\nvar Parser = function Parser(context, imports, fileInfo) {\n    var parsers,\n        parserInput = getParserInput();\n\n    function error(msg, type) {\n        throw new LessError(\n            {\n                index: parserInput.i,\n                filename: fileInfo.filename,\n                type: type || 'Syntax',\n                message: msg\n            },\n            imports\n        );\n    }\n\n    function expect(arg, msg, index) {\n        // some older browsers return typeof 'function' for RegExp\n        var result = (arg instanceof Function) ? arg.call(parsers) : parserInput.$re(arg);\n        if (result) {\n            return result;\n        }\n        error(msg || (typeof arg === 'string' ? \"expected '\" + arg + \"' got '\" + parserInput.currentChar() + \"'\"\n                                               : \"unexpected token\"));\n    }\n\n    // Specialization of expect()\n    function expectChar(arg, msg) {\n        if (parserInput.$char(arg)) {\n            return arg;\n        }\n        error(msg || \"expected '\" + arg + \"' got '\" + parserInput.currentChar() + \"'\");\n    }\n\n    function getDebugInfo(index) {\n        var filename = fileInfo.filename;\n\n        return {\n            lineNumber: utils.getLocation(index, parserInput.getInput()).line + 1,\n            fileName: filename\n        };\n    }\n\n    //\n    // The Parser\n    //\n    return {\n\n        //\n        // Parse an input string into an abstract syntax tree,\n        // @param str A string containing 'less' markup\n        // @param callback call `callback` when done.\n        // @param [additionalData] An optional map which can contains vars - a map (key, value) of variables to apply\n        //\n        parse: function (str, callback, additionalData) {\n            var root, error = null, globalVars, modifyVars, ignored, preText = \"\";\n\n            globalVars = (additionalData && additionalData.globalVars) ?
